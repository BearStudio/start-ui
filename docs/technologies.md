## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library created in 2013 to build
reactive user interfaces. At the time of writing, React is probably the front
end library the most used to create new projects and has a huge community which
is beneficial for the maintainability of the project in terms of developers and
online resources.

## React Router

Next.js is bundled with its own router, but at the time of writing those lines,
it does not allow nested routes using a shared layout.

## TypeScript

JavaScript is a not typed language. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
is here to help add static type definition. TypeScript helps a lot when it comes
to types, interfaces and define contract between functions which helps a lot for
a reliable documentation. No worry, the TypeScript adoption is incremental and
writing in TypeScript is not mandatory to use Start UI, but it is a good
practice to do so to avoid bugs in the future.
